# Mini_Tasks

# Task1
1. Obtain the Google Gemini API Key.
2. Set up the Python environment by installing the required libraries. (gemini, .)
3. Write simple Python code to call the Gemini API.
4. Explore and understand the different parameters of the Gemini API to control the output.
- Experiment with these parameters to learn how they work.
5. Learn how simple prompting works.
6. Finally, create a Python script to:
- Load text files.
- Summarize the content of the text files from Gemini (use publicly available text files from the internet).
  # [Modification for the first task]
We don't add API keys to the code and we don't push them to GitHub.

T1.2.1: Create a '.env' file and store API keys there. Here it is the GEMINI API KEY.

T1.2.2: You have used the "gemini-pro" model. Refer to what LLM models are available with Google.

T1.2.3: Compare the output of at least two models and prepare a table for comparison (use the same temperature, top-k, and top-p values for each model). Things to consider:
- Speed of generation / Token per second
- Number of input tokens and number of output tokens for each model (I think you might know the term "token" from the previous task)
- Accuracy (To check accuracy, ask a question that you know the answer to, like "2+3 = ?" for math questions)Identify
- Try to identify what are the strong areas and areas lacking on those models.

Ex Output : (Don't need to stick to this)


|Model Name| Speed of Generation | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Accuracy     |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|Model 1   |                     |              |               |             |
|Model 2   |                     |              |               |             |

T1.2.E1: Learn the common vocabulary used with LLMs (Token, embedding, RAG, etc.)

Create a separate folder for each task and add separate README.md files for each task where you write the results of those tasks.
